# Arduino Traffic Light Simulation 🚦

This project simulates a realistic traffic light using an Arduino board and three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green).

It was built and tested using the [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com/).

## 💡 Features

- Red → Red+Yellow → Green → Yellow → Red sequence
- Accurate traffic light timing
- Built using `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` functions

## 🧰 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 3 Resistors (220Ω recommended)
- Jumper wires

## 📁 Files

- `traffic_light.ino` – main Arduino code
- `diagram.json` – Wokwi simulation circuit layout

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open the `.ino` file in [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) or the Arduino IDE.
3. Simulate or upload to an actual Arduino board.
